# Car Rental GUI

## Overview
Car Rental GUI is a fully functional example project that demonstrates the integration of a MySQL database with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. 
The project aims to simulate a car rental company's operations by providing features such as user management, car reservation, and reservation management.

## Features
The Car Rental GUI offers the following features:

1. User Management: Users can create new accounts and log in to access the system.
2. Car Reservation: Users can reserve cars for specific dates, ensuring that reservations do not overlap with existing ones. The system checks the availability of cars before allowing reservations.
3. Reservation Management: Users can view and manage their reservations, including removing existing reservations.
4. MySQL Database Integration: The project connects to a MySQL database, allowing seamless storage and retrieval of data related to users, cars, and reservations.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are to showcase the integration of a MySQL database with a GUI and to demonstrate the implementation of car rental functionalities. 
By providing a user-friendly interface, the project aims to simulate real-world car rental scenarios, ensuring data integrity and preventing conflicting reservations.

## How to use it
Firstly you have to have mysql database already installed. You have to edit database_setup.py file by filling in your database information (host name, user and password), and then run it.
Since I didn't create super user, you will have to insert specific car models into car table. 
<br/> After that your ready to register and use the app freely.
